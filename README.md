## Task 1 â€“ Unemployment Data Analysis
### Description
The first stage of the project focused on understanding the unemployment dataset and building a foundation for further tasks. This involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

### Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

### Key Contributions
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw unemployment data for analysis.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends across regions, industries, and time.  
- Created visualizations (line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps) to show unemployment variations.  
- Identified patterns such as seasonal unemployment and regional disparities.  

### Results
- Established clear understanding of unemployment rate fluctuations.  
- Highlighted regions/sectors with consistently higher unemployment.  
- Produced visual insights that will guide predictive modeling in upcoming tasks.
